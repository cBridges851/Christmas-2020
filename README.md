## Motivation
I wanted to wish people a Merry Christmas in 2020, and felt it would be interesting to give them good wishes in a new way! I wanted to put my A-Frame skills to the test, and had a go at making a virtual Christmas card!

## Tech/Framework
This uses A-Frame, a framework that is used to create web VR scenes. This was created inside a HTML file.
